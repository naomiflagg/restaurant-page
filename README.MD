# Restaurant page

This fake restaurant page was developed as part of The Odin Project's [Ruby on Rails Curriculum](http://www.theodinproject.com). The purpose was to work with ES6 modules to develop almost all of the site's DOM content using JS.

The page can be viewed [here](https://naomiflagg.github.io/restaurant-page/).
